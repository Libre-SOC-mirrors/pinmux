# How to add a new peripheral

This document describes the process of adding a new peripheral to
the pinmux and auto-generator, through a worked example, adding
SDRAM.

# Creating the specifications

The tool is split into two halves that are separated by tab-separated
files.  The first step is therefore to add a function that defines
the peripheral as a python function.  That implies in turn that the
pinouts of the peripheral must be known.  Looking at the BSV code
for the SDRAM peripheral, we find its interface is defined as follows:

    interface Ifc_sdram_out;
        (*always_enabled,always_ready*)
        method Action ipad_sdr_din(Bit#(64) pad_sdr_din);
        method Bit#(9) sdram_sdio_ctrl();
        method Bit#(64) osdr_dout();
        method Bit#(8) osdr_den_n();
        method Bool osdr_cke();
        method Bool osdr_cs_n();
        method Bool osdr_ras_n ();
        method Bool osdr_cas_n ();
        method Bool osdr_we_n ();
        method Bit#(8) osdr_dqm ();
        method Bit#(2) osdr_ba ();
        method Bit#(13) osdr_addr ();
        interface Clock sdram_clk;
    endinterface

So now we go to src/spec/pinfunctions.py and add a corresponding function
that returns a list of all of the required pin signals.  However, we note
that it is a huge number of pins so a decision is made to split it into
groups: sdram1, sdram2 and sdram3.  Firstly, sdram1, covering the base
functionality:

def sdram1(suffix, bank):
    buspins = []
    inout = []
    for i in range(8):
        pname = "SDRDQM%d*" % i
        buspins.append(pname)
    for i in range(8):
        pname = "SDRD%d*" % i
        buspins.append(pname)
        inout.append(pname)
    for i in range(12):
        buspins.append("SDRAD%d+" % i)
    for i in range(8):
        buspins.append("SDRDEN%d+" % i)
    for i in range(2):
        buspins.append("SDRBA%d+" % i)
    buspins += ['SDRCKE+', 'SDRRASn+', 'SDRCASn+', 'SDRWEn+',
                'SDRCSn0++']
    return (buspins, inout)

This function, if used on its own, would define an 8-bit SDRAM bus with
12-bit addressing. Checking off the names against the corresponding BSV
definition we find
